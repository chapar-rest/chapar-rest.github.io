Workspaces are a way to organize your requests and collections. You can create multiple workspaces to separate your requests and collections based on your needs.
Chapr comes with a default workspace where by default all your requests and collections are stored. 

#### Create a Workspace
To create a new workspace, go to Workspaces tab and click on the "New Workspace" button. You can give your workspace a name.
