Good documentation is essential for any project. Here’s how you can contribute to the documentation:

1. **Identify areas for improvement:** Look for typos, unclear sections, or outdated information in the existing documentation.
2. **Edit the documentation:** Make the necessary changes in the documentation files. These are usually found in the docs folder or as README.md files in various directories.
3. **Follow the same process:** Use the same GitHub flow and Conventional Commits Specification as you would for code contributions.
4. **Submit a Pull Request:** Provide a clear explanation of the documentation improvements you made.
